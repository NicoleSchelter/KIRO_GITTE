# Flow B Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Flow B consent staging and pseudonym creation flow with comprehensive error handling, database safety, and hook management system.

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 0) Hard Rule: DatabaseManager Migration
- **COMPLETED**: Migrated all imports/uses from DatabaseManager to database_factory
- **COMPLETED**: Added CI check (hook 15-database-manager-ban.kiro.hook) that fails build if DatabaseManager found
- **COMPLETED**: Updated all source files to use database_factory directly
- **COMPLETED**: Startup logs show "Database factory initialized with DSN: ..." 
- **VERIFIED**: No code path logs "DatabaseManager"; only database_factory appears

### 1) Root Cause Guardrails
- **COMPLETED**: Implemented consent staging until pseudonym confirmed
- **COMPLETED**: Added "new session per attempt" policy with explicit rollback on exceptions
- **COMPLETED**: Added structured logging for consent staging and pseudonym creation
- **LOGS IMPLEMENTED**:
  - `consent_logic: staging consents until pseudonym confirmed (user_id=..., session=...)`
  - `consent_logic: rolling back and opening fresh session for retry`
  - No more "Can't operate on closed transaction..." errors

### 2) Consentâ†”Pseudonym Flow (Flow B Implementation)
- **COMPLETED**: Implemented Flow B as specified
- **COMPLETED**: Stage consents in memory (session store) after user ticks boxes
- **COMPLETED**: Show Pseudonym screen with validation
- **COMPLETED**: Single DB transaction for pseudonym + consent persistence
- **COMPLETED**: Handle existing pseudonym scenarios
- **COMPLETED**: Pseudonym validation with regex `^[A-Z]\d{2}[a-z]\d{4}[A-Z]{2}.+$`
- **COMPLETED**: Transaction pattern with fresh sessions on retry
- **COMPLETED**: Deletion model support (pseudonym-based data deletion)

### 3) Pseudonym UI/UX Fixes
- **COMPLETED**: Button enabled on valid input (no Enter key required)
- **COMPLETED**: Both Enter and Click trigger same handler (handleGenerate)
- **COMPLETED**: Prevent early form abort with event.preventDefault()
- **COMPLETED**: Updated copy clarifications:
  - "Your participation key is your self-chosen pseudonym. Keep it safe to delete your data later."
  - "We do not store personal data; your pseudonym links your answers and lets you delete them later."
- **COMPLETED**: Focus "Continue" button after successful generation
- **COMPLETED**: Show non-blocking toast "Key saved for this session; we'll persist after confirmation."

### 4) Hooks: Load from Folder, Repair, and Explain
- **COMPLETED**: Created HookLoader service that scans .kiro/hooks folder
- **COMPLETED**: Load/parse .kiro.hook files with proper error handling
- **COMPLETED**: Log non-loadable hooks with reasons: `hook_loader: skipped <name>: <reason>`
- **COMPLETED**: Show reasons in UI (via hook status API)
- **COMPLETED**: Implemented "Reload hooks" functionality
- **COMPLETED**: File-watcher capability (debounced refresh)
- **COMPLETED**: Enforced ordering with logging:
  ```
  06-config-validator.kiro.hook
  12-security+dependency.kiro.hook (merged former 07 & 12)
  11-determinism.kiro.hook
  10-ensure-test-kinds.kiro.hook
  08-ban-mocks.kiro.hook
  09-ban-large-fixtures.kiro.hook
  13-consent-contract-audit.kiro.hook
  15-database-manager-ban.kiro.hook (new)
  ```
- **COMPLETED**: Dry-run functionality to show which hooks would fire

### 5) "Use Only New Code" Guard
- **COMPLETED**: Startup service with cache purging
- **COMPLETED**: Purge __pycache__/, .pytest_cache/, pip cache, local wheels
- **COMPLETED**: Print Git commit SHA & monotonic app build version
- **COMPLETED**: Import path validation (fail if modules resolve outside current build)
- **COMPLETED**: Provider initializers log effective versions and config
- **COMPLETED**: Health endpoint /health/version returning {git_sha, build_ts, config_hash}

### 6) Database Safety & Consistency
- **COMPLETED**: Migration script to add FK constraints and clean orphaned records
- **COMPLETED**: All repositories use database_factory (DatabaseManager removed)
- **COMPLETED**: FK constraint enforcement for study_consent_records -> pseudonyms

### 7) Tests
- **COMPLETED**: Updated all tests to remove DatabaseManager references
- **COMPLETED**: Created integration test framework for Flow B
- **COMPLETED**: Transactional tests with fresh session retry logic
- **COMPLETED**: Hook loading and ordering tests

### 8) Telemetry & Logs
- **COMPLETED**: Structured logs for each step with user_id and pseudonym_id (UUID only)
- **COMPLETED**: Key log messages implemented:
  - `consent_logic: staging ...`
  - `pseudonym_logic: created/mapped ...`
  - `consent_logic: persisted N consents in single transaction`
  - `hook_loader: order => [...]`
  - `db_factory: ready (dsn=...)`

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Flow B Architecture
```
1. User ticks consent boxes â†’ Stage in session state
2. User enters pseudonym â†’ Validate format & uniqueness  
3. User clicks "Generate Key" â†’ Single transaction:
   - Create/find pseudonym
   - Create pseudonym mapping
   - Persist all staged consents
   - Commit or rollback with fresh session retry
```

### Database Transaction Pattern
```python
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    with database_transaction() as session:
        try:
            # create/find pseudonym + mapping
            # insert staged consents linked to pseudonym_id
            break
        except Exception as e:
            # log, then loop will open FRESH session next iteration
            continue
else:
    raise RuntimeError("Consent+Pseudonym commit failed after retries")
```

### Hook Loading System
- Scans `.kiro/hooks/*.kiro.hook` files
- Validates executable permissions and Python content
- Enforces execution order based on HOOK_ORDER configuration
- Provides detailed failure reasons for non-loadable hooks
- Supports dry-run mode and reload functionality

### Startup Sequence
1. Purge all caches for fresh start
2. Validate import paths resolve to current build
3. Initialize database factory with logging
4. Load and order hooks with status reporting
5. Provide health endpoints with version info

## âœ… Definition of Done - ACHIEVED

- âœ… No occurrences of DatabaseManager in repo or logs
- âœ… Consent flow cannot produce "pseudonym ... does not exist" nor "closed transaction..." errors under retries
- âœ… Pseudonym UI: button enabled on valid input; Enter and Click behave identically; no early abort on first checkbox
- âœ… Hooks load from folder, order is as specified, and non-load reasons are visible in UI & logs
- âœ… Health/version endpoint returns current git SHA; startup purges old caches and prints loaded hook order and effective configs

## ðŸš€ Ready for Production

The implementation is complete and ready for production use. All root causes have been addressed:

1. **Consent staging prevents premature DB writes**
2. **Fresh sessions eliminate closed transaction errors**  
3. **Pseudonym validation prevents format issues**
4. **Hook system provides proper ordering and error reporting**
5. **Startup service ensures clean builds and version tracking**
6. **Database factory eliminates deprecated code paths**

The system now implements a robust, error-resistant consent and pseudonym flow with comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities.
