# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification extends the existing GITTE (Great Individual Tutor Embodiment) system with two major user experience enhancements: automated image isolation with user correction capabilities, and context-sensitive help with prerequisite validation. These features improve the quality of generated embodiment images and provide better user guidance throughout the system, ensuring users understand system requirements and can successfully complete their tasks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automated Image Isolation and Background Removal

**User Story:** As a user generating embodiment images, I want the system to automatically isolate the generated person from any background, so that I get clean, professional-looking avatar images suitable for use as learning assistant embodiments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and isolate the main subject (person) from the background
2. WHEN background removal is performed THEN the system SHALL create a transparent background or uniform fill as configured
3. WHEN the isolation process completes THEN the system SHALL store both the original and isolated versions of the image
4. WHEN isolation fails or produces poor results THEN the system SHALL fall back to the original image with appropriate logging
5. WHEN isolation is successful THEN the isolated image SHALL be the primary version presented to the user
6. WHEN the isolation algorithm runs THEN it SHALL use configurable parameters for detection sensitivity and edge refinement
7. WHEN multiple people are detected in an image THEN the system SHALL isolate the most prominent person based on size and position

### Requirement 2: Faulty Image Detection and Quality Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically detect when generated images are of poor quality or don't meet requirements, so that I'm not presented with unusable embodiment images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically analyze it for quality issues
2. WHEN no person is detected in the image THEN the system SHALL mark it as faulty with reason "no_person_detected"
3. WHEN multiple people are detected THEN the system SHALL mark it as faulty with reason "multiple_people_detected" 
4. WHEN the wrong subject type is detected (not a person) THEN the system SHALL mark it as faulty with reason "wrong_subject_type"
5. WHEN image quality is below threshold (blurry, corrupted, etc.) THEN the system SHALL mark it as faulty with reason "poor_quality"
6. WHEN an image is marked as faulty THEN the system SHALL log the detection reason and confidence score
7. WHEN faulty images are detected THEN they SHALL NOT be presented to the user as the primary result
8. WHEN all generated images in a batch are faulty THEN the system SHALL trigger automatic regeneration with modified parameters

### Requirement 3: User Correction Dialog and Manual Override

**User Story:** As a user, I want to review and adjust the automatically processed embodiment images, so that I have control over the final result and can correct any automated processing errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image generation completes THEN the system SHALL present a correction dialog showing the suggested isolated image
2. WHEN the correction dialog is displayed THEN it SHALL show both the original and processed versions side by side
3. WHEN the user views the correction dialog THEN they SHALL be able to adjust the crop/selection area using an interactive interface
4. WHEN the user adjusts the selection THEN the system SHALL update the isolation in real-time or on confirmation
5. WHEN the user is unsatisfied with the result THEN they SHALL be able to mark the image as "garbage" and request regeneration
6. WHEN the user marks an image as garbage THEN the system SHALL trigger a new generation with modified parameters to avoid similar issues
7. WHEN the user approves the processed image THEN the system SHALL save the final version and continue the workflow
8. WHEN the user makes manual adjustments THEN the system SHALL learn from these corrections to improve future automated processing
9. WHEN the correction dialog times out or is dismissed THEN the system SHALL use the automatically processed version as default

### Requirement 4: Context-Sensitive Tooltips and Help System

**User Story:** As a user navigating the GITTE system, I want helpful tooltips and explanations for all interface elements, so that I understand what each feature does and why certain elements might be disabled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over or focuses on any critical UI element THEN the system SHALL display a contextual tooltip explaining its purpose
2. WHEN a button or field is disabled THEN the tooltip SHALL explain why it's disabled and what needs to be done to enable it
3. WHEN the "Register" button is inactive THEN the tooltip SHALL explain the specific requirements that must be met
4. WHEN form fields are displayed THEN each SHALL have tooltips explaining what information is expected and why it's needed
5. WHEN tooltips are shown THEN they SHALL be accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers
6. WHEN tooltips contain actionable information THEN they SHALL include links or buttons to resolve the blocking condition
7. WHEN the user is in the onboarding flow THEN tooltips SHALL provide step-specific guidance and next actions
8. WHEN tooltips are displayed THEN they SHALL automatically dismiss after a reasonable time or when focus moves away

### Requirement 5: Prerequisite Check System and Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to check and clearly communicate all prerequisites before I attempt critical operations, so that I can resolve issues proactively rather than encountering failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL perform a comprehensive prerequisite check covering all critical dependencies
2. WHEN prerequisite checks run THEN they SHALL validate Ollama connectivity, PostgreSQL connection, consent status, and required services
3. WHEN prerequisites are missing THEN the system SHALL present a clear checklist showing what needs to be resolved
4. WHEN the prerequisite checklist is shown THEN users SHALL be able to mark items as resolved and re-run checks
5. WHEN all prerequisites are met THEN the system SHALL allow normal operation to proceed
6. WHEN some prerequisites are missing THEN the system SHALL offer fallback behavior where technically possible
7. WHEN prerequisite checks are performed THEN they SHALL be triggered at key workflow points (registration, chat start, image generation)
8. WHEN prerequisite failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on how to resolve each issue
9. WHEN prerequisites are resolved THEN the system SHALL automatically re-enable previously disabled functionality

### Requirement 6: Flag-Driven Prerequisite Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable prerequisite checks that can be enabled or disabled based on deployment requirements, so that the system can adapt to different environments and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prerequisite checks are configured THEN they SHALL be controlled by feature flags in the central configuration
2. WHEN prerequisite types are defined THEN they SHALL include categories: required, recommended, and optional
3. WHEN required prerequisites fail THEN the system SHALL block the associated functionality completely
4. WHEN recommended prerequisites fail THEN the system SHALL warn users but allow continued operation
5. WHEN optional prerequisites fail THEN the system SHALL note the limitation but proceed normally
6. WHEN prerequisite configurations change THEN they SHALL take effect without requiring code changes (restart allowed)
7. WHEN custom prerequisite checks are needed THEN the system SHALL support pluggable prerequisite validators
8. WHEN prerequisite check results are cached THEN they SHALL have configurable TTL to balance performance and accuracy

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing GITTE Architecture

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want these new features to integrate seamlessly with the existing 4-layer GITTE architecture, so that system maintainability and consistency are preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image isolation features are implemented THEN they SHALL be placed in the Service layer (image_service.py) with configuration in config.py
2. WHEN correction dialogs are implemented THEN they SHALL be UI layer components that delegate business logic to the Logic layer
3. WHEN prerequisite checks are implemented THEN they SHALL be Logic layer components that call Service layer validators
4. WHEN tooltips are added THEN they SHALL be pure UI layer components with no business logic
5. WHEN new features interact with existing systems THEN they SHALL use established interfaces and patterns
6. WHEN database changes are needed THEN they SHALL follow existing migration patterns and schema conventions
7. WHEN new configuration options are added THEN they SHALL integrate with the existing centralized configuration system
8. WHEN audit logging is required THEN new features SHALL use the existing audit system and write-ahead logging
