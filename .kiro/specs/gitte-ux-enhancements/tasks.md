# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan converts the GITTE UX enhancements design into a series of discrete, manageable coding tasks. Each task builds incrementally on previous work, following test-driven development practices and maintaining the strict 4-layer architecture. The plan prioritizes core functionality first, then adds user interface enhancements, and finally integrates advanced features.
