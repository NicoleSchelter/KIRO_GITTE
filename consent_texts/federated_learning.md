# Federated Learning Consent

## What is Federated Learning
Federated learning is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that allows:
- Training AI models without centralizing your personal data
- Learning from collective patterns while keeping your data local
- Improving system performance through collaborative learning
- Maintaining individual privacy in shared AI development
- Contributing to research without data exposure

## How it works
In federated learning:
1. AI models are trained locally on your device/session
2. Only model updates (not your data) are shared
3. Updates are aggregated with other users' updates
4. Improved models are distributed back to all participants
5. Your personal data never leaves your local environment

## What you contribute
Your participation provides:
- Local model training using your learning patterns
- Anonymized model improvement suggestions
- Validation of AI personalization approaches
- Testing of privacy-preserving learning techniques
- Research data for educational AI advancement

## Privacy protections
Federated learning protects your privacy through:
- **Data minimization**: Only model parameters are shared, not raw data
- **Differential privacy**: Mathematical privacy guarantees in model updates
- **Secure aggregation**: Encrypted combination of model updates
- **Local computation**: Your data stays on your device/session
- **Anonymization**: No personal identifiers in shared model updates

## Research applications
Your federated learning participation supports:
- Development of better personalized learning algorithms
- Research on privacy-preserving AI in education
- Improvement of tutoring system effectiveness
- Creation of more inclusive and diverse AI models
- Advancement of responsible AI practices

## Technical implementation
Our federated learning system:
- Uses state-of-the-art privacy-preserving protocols
- Implements differential privacy with epsilon < 1.0
- Employs secure multi-party computation techniques
- Includes byzantine fault tolerance for robust learning
- Provides cryptographic guarantees for data protection

## Benefits to you
Participating in federated learning provides:
- Better personalized learning experiences over time
- Improved AI tutor responses and recommendations
- More diverse and inclusive AI behavior
- Contribution to cutting-edge educational research
- Access to continuously improving AI capabilities

## Data used in federated learning
The following data contributes to local model training:
- Learning interaction patterns (anonymized)
- Response accuracy and timing patterns
- Content engagement metrics
- Personalization preference indicators
- System usage and navigation patterns

**Note**: Raw personal data, conversations, and identifying information are never used.

## Frequency and duration
Federated learning activities:
- Run automatically in the background during system use
- Occur approximately once per week when you're active
- Take minimal computational resources
- Can be paused or disabled at any time
- Continue only while you remain an active user

## Opting out
You can opt out by:
- Disabling federated learning in your privacy settings
- Continuing to use all other system features normally
- Requesting removal from all federated learning activities
- Switching to a purely local learning mode
- Contacting support for assistance with opt-out

## Research ethics
Our federated learning research:
- Has been approved by institutional ethics committees
- Follows international guidelines for AI research ethics
- Maintains the highest standards of participant protection
- Provides regular updates on research progress and findings
- Ensures all participants can access research results

## Security measures
We protect federated learning through:
- End-to-end encryption of all model updates
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Compliance with international privacy regulations
- Restricted access to aggregated learning data
- Continuous monitoring for potential privacy breaches

## International compliance
Our federated learning complies with:
- GDPR (European Union)
- CCPA (California)
- PIPEDA (Canada)
- Other applicable privacy laws and regulations
- International research ethics standards
