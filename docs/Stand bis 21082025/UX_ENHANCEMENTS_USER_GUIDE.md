## Image Correction System

### Overview

The Image Correction System automatically detects issues with generated images and provides tools to fix them manually or regenerate them with improvements.

### Features

#### Automatic Quality Detection
- **Multi-person detection**: Identifies when multiple people appear in an image
- **Quality analysis**: Detects blur, noise, poor lighting, and other quality issues
- **Subject validation**: Ensures the generated image matches the intended subject type

#### Manual Correction Tools
- **Interactive cropping**: Adjust image boundaries with real-time preview
- **Background removal**: Isolate the main subject from the background
- **Quality enhancement**: Apply filters to improve image clarity

#### Smart Regeneration
- **Feedback-based regeneration**: System learns from your corrections to improve future generations
- **Priority handling**: Mark corrections as high priority for faster processing
- **Modification suggestions**: Provide specific guidance for better results

### How to Use

1. **Automatic Detection**
   - When you generate an image, the system automatically analyzes its quality
   - If issues are detected, you'll see a correction dialog

2. **Making Corrections**
   - **Accept**: Keep the processed image as-is
   - **Adjust**: Use manual cropping tools to fix the image
   - **Reject**: Discard the image and provide feedback
   - **Regenerate**: Create a new image with your suggested improvements

3. **Manual Cropping**
   - Click and drag to select the area you want to keep
   - Use the preview to see your changes in real-time
   - Click "Apply Crop" to finalize your selection

4. **Providing Feedback**
   - Select the reason for rejection (e.g., "Multiple people", "Poor quality")
   - Add specific suggestions for improvement
   - Set priority level for regeneration

### Best Practices

- **Be specific with feedback**: Detailed suggestions help the system learn and improve
- **Use manual cropping for minor adjustments**: It's faster than regeneration for small fixes
- **Mark important corrections as high priority**: This ensures faster processing
- **Review the preview carefully**: Make sure your corrections achieve the desired result
