## Task 18: Final Integration and System Validation

**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

### Overview

This document summarizes the final integration and system validation work completed for the GITTE Study Participation and Onboarding Flow. The integration ensures all components work together seamlessly while maintaining the existing 4-layer architecture and providing comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.

## Integration Components Validated

- **Data Layer**: `src/data/` - Models, repositories, and database schema

**Key Integration Points:**
- Main UI (`src/ui/main.py`) properly routes to study participation flow
- Onboarding UI (`src/ui/onboarding_ui.py`) integrates study participation components
- Study Participation UI (`src/ui/study_participation_ui.py`) provides pseudonym and consent interfaces
- All layers properly separated with defined interfaces

### 2. Database Schema Integration ✅
